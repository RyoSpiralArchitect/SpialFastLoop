# Contributing

## Development environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/SpiralFastLoop.git
cd SpiralFastLoop
pip install -e SpiralFastLoop[dev]
pre-commit install
```

We target **Python 3.9+** and **PyTorch â‰¥ 2.1**. Installing the `dev` extra pulls in
linters, type checkers, and testing tools that mirror CI.

## Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Run the formatting and lint suite locally before committing:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

3. Execute the unit tests (with coverage) and optional property tests:

   ```bash
   pytest --cov
   ```

4. Use `scripts/collect_metrics.py` to gather recurring quality signals (coverage,
   benchmark smoke tests) when preparing a release.
5. Open a pull request that links to any relevant issues and describe observable
   changes.

## Coding guidelines

- Keep functions and methods fully type annotated. CI enforces `mypy --strict`.
- Follow the Black/Isort code style (88 columns, deterministic imports).
- Prefer small, focused modules with clear boundaries between the engine, extras,
  and utilities packages.
- When touching tensor math, include regression tests that exercise boundary
  values (negative, zero, large magnitude) and non-default devices when possible.

## Benchmarks and telemetry

- Use `examples/bench_synth.py` (or your own scripts) to gather performance
  numbers. Record device, PyTorch version, and batch size in PRs.
- `scripts/collect_metrics.py` offers a quick way to capture throughput snapshots
  alongside coverage statistics for release notes.
